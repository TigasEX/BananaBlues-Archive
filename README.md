NOTE (2026): The game is deprecated and probably won't run.

HOW TO RUN THE GAME:
Run the .exe on the BB on the root of the package.

CONTROLS:
Walk around in the 3rd person camera mode with the WASD keys. 
You can also dash while in this mode with the Spacebar (the impulse of the dash stays when you enter first person).
Press the Mouse2 Key to change to 1st person camera mode, where you can shoot with the Mouse1 Key, and reload with R.
When entering 1st person mode, you will be looking towards where you are holding WASD (ie. if you hold left, you will enter 1st person looking left).
In either mode you can press E to deploy a C4. Press E again to explode it.
